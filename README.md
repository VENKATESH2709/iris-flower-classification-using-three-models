Project Title: Classification Model Comparison

Description
This project involves comparing the performance of three different classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The models are trained on a dataset to predict a target variable, and their performance is evaluated using accuracy as the metric.

Notebook Contents
Data Loading and Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to remove any irrelevant information and prepare it for model training.
Model Training
Three different models are trained on the dataset:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Model Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy as the metric.
Results of the model evaluations:
Accuracy of Logistic Regression: 0.967
Accuracy of Random Forest: 0.967
Accuracy of Gradient Boosting: 0.967
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of three different classification models on a dataset and compares their performance based on accuracy. All three models showed similar performance with an accuracy of approximately 96.67%.
